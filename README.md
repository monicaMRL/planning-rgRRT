# planning-rgRRT
This was the project I did under Prof. David Meger. 

Abstract: Even the simplest robot model is subject to differential constraint. In robotics most problems involve differential constraints that arise from kinematics and dynamics of the robot. In order to plan a collision free path for robot which it can successfully follow its important to consider these constraints while planning. This project studies a very popular randomized path planning technique called RRT-Planning and apply it for a simple robot model with differential constraints. In order to deal with differential constraints a new sampling technique is studied in the report which is based on feasibility sets. Report also discusses in details theory of reachability sets and discusses reachability sets for simple car motion. Properties of RRTs and how the differential constraint problem affect those properties are also discussed in the report. Finally report also discusses the scope of improvement in the studied algorithms.
